<!--FOR FUTURE UPDATE:
1. State additional info in index.js to NOT insert additional functions or tests for index.js
2. remove index.test.js OR add text saying errors could be caused by running tests and functions within index.js due to imports being present.
3. Fix image error - images do not appear.
4. Provide link to image with font examples.
5. Add additional styling for styles.css (center and clean up hello world text), base styles for a basic site (very simple styling), additional stock images. and     base slightly more extensive HTML setup (with things commented out). Add function that auto generates html/css.
6. Add quick links/resources folder in assets which include good resources and links to documentation to help with coding.
7. Add "jest": true in .eslintrc.
8. In package.json include single line comments that tell the user things they should change: name, version, description, main if needed.
9. In README.md add additional single line comments on things that should be changed if needed.
10. Add Text document that provides additional info to user and access to resources for helping with support. As well as a github pages site that helps display        documentation and a video on usage.
